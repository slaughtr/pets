    <h1>We have many pets. Nate has the most. Wow Nate, you rock!</h1>
    <p>First, we'll talk about Dallas's one pet. Wow Dallas, try harder.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Seymour Butts</h2>
    <img src="img/seymour.jpg" alt="omg where'd he go?!">
    <p>Seymour Reginald Butts is a fantastic dog. He is of unknown breed, but whatever they were, they sure made a <strong>cute</strong> pupper.</p>
    <p>Mr Butts (as he's known on the town) is small, hairy, and brown. And cute. Don't forget the cute.</p>
    <p>He likes to eat lots of things. His favorites (in order) are:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Poop</li>
      <li>Treats that look kinda like poop</li>
      <li>Snow</li>
      <li>Dog food</li>
      <li>Plastic wrappers</li>
    </ol>
    <p>He also has a lot of toys! Too many to mention. But know that he really hates that giraffe.</p>
    <p>And if we all get teleported to the future, he'll look a lot like <a href="https://youtu.be/W6GDil0rGls">this</a> which would be <em>very</em> sad so let's hope that never happens. </p>

    <h1>Nate's Pets:</h1>
    <h2>Momo</h2>
    <img src="img/moeAndI.jpg" alt="Moe not being harassed for once.">
    <p>Momo, aka Moe Meowsimi, alias Mr. Oweeowerson is almost 4 years old.</p>
    <p>He is <strong><em>extremely</em></strong> affectionate. He is also extremely vocal. He "low-ows" constantly. His voice sounds absurdly goofy.</p>
    <p>He is also the softest little boy in soft little boy town.</p>
    <p>He was adopted from the <a href="http://http://www.oregonhumane.org/">Oregon Humane Society</a> on Columbia Highway.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Concetta</h2>
    <img src="img/notConcetta.jpg" alt="The snake in the middle looks like concetta as a baby.">
    <p>Concetta is a female corn snake. She is about 6 feet long and approximately 5 years old.</p>
    <p>She has no personality whatsoever. She is a mindless killing machine. But, she is pretty which is all that is expected of her.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Many Subtropical Freshwater Fish</h2>
    <p>Nate has many small freshwater fish. None of them are named except for a rainbow shark which Nate's daughter calls Rain Bowie.</p>
